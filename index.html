            <p>I'm a second-year <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-computer-vision/">MSCV</a> student at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">the Robotics Institute</a>, Carnegie Mellon University, working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe?pli=1">Prof. Shinji Watanabe</a> and <a href="https://laszlojeni.com/index.html#lab">Prof. László A. Jeni</a>. I'm also collaborating with <a href="https://zyliatzju.github.io/">Prof. Zhongyu Li</a>. I earned my bachelor's degree in CS from Beijing Normal University in June 2024.</p>
            <p>My research interests lie in human-centric topics, including <b>multimodal generative models</b>, <b>digital humans</b>, and <b>humanoids</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Goal:</b> I want my research to benefit people—to be useful and fun. I believe multimodal signals have a natural alignment and complementarity with each other. As the inputs and outputs of human beings, they make our lives vibrant and fascinating. At the same time, I want these ideas to be grounded in the same physical world as myself, to interact deeply with people, and to continuously learn from the environment.</p>
            <div class="gradient-separator"></div>
            <p><b>Misc:</b> I love figure skating, a beautiful fusion of highly dynamic, precise motion and rich multimodal signals. I also love Winnie the Pooh, the kindest little bear in the world, who has been my best buddy since I was two.</p>
            <p><b>Thanks:</b> I've had the great honor of working with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=kHKwQ9gAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Teng Han</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=OH7-k7oAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Prof. Yongzhen Huang</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=voqw10cAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Shanghang Zhang</a> during my undergraduate study. 
                There are also many senior colleagues and mentors who have given me invaluable advice and guidance.
                My deepest thanks go to them, for they generously offered me opportunities to explore and experiment.</p>
